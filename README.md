### Tiddlywiki recommended rules
The other rules/guidelines for the competition are:

* The version number must be clear and readable even when the banner is shown at a reduced size
* The version number must use the correct punctuation including the “v” prefix and clear full stops between the numbers
* The image must be a PNG or JPEG of exactly 560x315 pixels
* Note that the image is displayed at a smaller size on tiddlywiki.com 1, so check that your artwork is legible at the display size (the scaling is done in order to yield good quality on hi-dpi displays)
* The bottom 46 pixels will be obscured by the banner text “What’s new in 5.2.3” when it is displayed within HelloThere
* The image need not include the word “TiddlyWiki”. The banner image is only used in contexts where it is clear that it is about TiddlyWiki
* Feel free to enter an updated version of artwork that was a runner-up in a previous competition
